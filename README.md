🦖 Dino Jump+ – The Modern Chrome Dino Game!
📌 Inspiration
The classic Chrome Dino Game has entertained users during offline moments for years. We reimagined it with a modern design, responsive UI, and power-ups while keeping the core fun intact.

🎮 What It Does
Dino Jump+ is a browser-based arcade game where players control a dinosaur to jump over obstacles and achieve high scores. It features:

✅ Smooth jump mechanics with gravity & physics

🌟 Real-time score and high score tracking

📱 Fully responsive design (mobile-friendly controls)

🌌 Dynamic backgrounds and animated UI

🔥 Difficulty increases with time (speed scaling)

🧠 Intelligent obstacle generation logic

🎮 Touch, click, and keyboard support

⚙️ How We Built It
Built entirely using React + Tailwind CSS, we focused on performance and user experience:

🎨 Canvas API for smooth rendering and animations

⚛️ React Hooks to manage game loop, physics, and state

🧩 Modular components: GameCanvas, GameUI, MobileControls

💾 LocalStorage to persist high score

🧠 Responsive gameplay logic using requestAnimationFrame

🚀 Features
Jump mechanic with gravity + collision detection

Obstacles aligned perfectly with the dino's feet

Adaptive game speed that ramps up with score

Mobile support (tap to jump!)

Game states: waiting, playing, game over

Stylized UI with overlays, gradients, and transitions

🔍 Challenges We Faced
Fine-tuning collision physics and jump control

Achieving pixel-perfect alignment for dino and obstacles

Managing game loop without performance drops

Supporting both mobile and desktop inputs

🧠 What We Learned
How to manage canvas animations within a React app

Dynamic UI rendering using Canvas API

Game state management with useRef, useEffect, and requestAnimationFrame

Responsive design using Tailwind and custom media queries

💡 What's Next?
Power-ups like double jump, shield, or slow motion

Customizable dino skins 🧑‍🎨

Multiplayer version using WebSockets

PWA Support (Installable Dino Jump+ on phones!)
